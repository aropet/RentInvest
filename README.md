# RentInvest

1. DESCRIPTION - Describe the package in a few paragraphs.

This readme is for how to consume this repository and deploy locally. No hosting needed. We used D3 libraries hosted online in our HTML, so internet connection is required. Also, due to CORS restrictions in Chrome, this runs in Firefox with the local html file. We tested only with firefox.

This program leverages views that were created on our 1.3 GB Azure SQL Database and imported into Power Bi to transpose, clean and refine and then exported as CSV files to be easily and quickly manipulated by D3. We leveraged many of the skills that we learned during the D3 homework and modules to create forms, labels, graphs, buttons, etc.

2. INSTALLATION - How to install and setup your code.

Download the CODE folder. The only other requirement is using the Firefox browser and having an internet connection (even when running locally).


3. EXECUTION - How to run a demo on your code.

Launch main.html inside the directory using ONLY a Firefox Browser (DO NOT USE CHROME, FIREFOX ONLY). Thatâ€™s all needed to run this web app locally.
Change the parameter to analyze the risk for Seattle Area Zip Code only. This somewhat toy dataset is for only 36 Zip Codes in Seattle Area and our user inputs are restricted to those for now.
